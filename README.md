# wmi-assassin
Kills those pesky WMI objects


This is the script I have used to eradicate a WMI object infection. It was an infection caused by a crypto miner worm, stored payload, automated job and propagation techniques in wmi objects.

You WILL need to ensure that the filter strings are correct for your particular infection - they are not all the same. THis is just a nifty way to kill it using impacket. I suck at windows, so its always easier for me to script something in linux.
